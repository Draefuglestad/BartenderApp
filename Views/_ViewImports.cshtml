<!--The purpose of the _ViewImports.cshtml file is to provide a mechanism to make directives available to Razor pages
globally so that you don't have to add them to pages individually.

    The at using statement will allow us to use the types in the BartenderApp.Models namespace in views
    without needing to refer to the namespace.

    The ar addTagHelper statement enables the built-in tag helpers, which we use later to create HTML elements
    that reflect the configuration of the BartenderApp application.-->
