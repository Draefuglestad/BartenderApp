# BartenderApp

Individual practice project for Senior Project.

Purpose of this program is to create a MVC application
where users can order drinks from a cocktail list and bartenders 
can complete the order request using admin features.

This application is created using a local database and admin must be authorized 
for proper access. To create an admin account, run the program and
navigate to /account/create.

This project is basic and has not yet explored features that I plan on adding throughout
the senior project course as I progress in skill. Here are things I plan to implement in the future:
1. Connect to remote database using Azure
2. More asthetics involved with layout design
3. Sending a text to the user when their drink is ready
4. Better control of account admin features - creating some sort of validation process for the user to be able to create an admin account 
that they can navigate to from a view page instead of the URL route.
